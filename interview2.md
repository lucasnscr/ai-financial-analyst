### T – Task
"My responsibility was to design and implement a scalable platform architecture that would streamline product development and channel integration. Additionally, I contributed to thought leadership by publishing articles on platform digitization and business transformation, sharing insights with the wider community."

### A – Action
"I developed a modular banking platform that used microservices and APIs to enable faster development cycles. By leveraging automation tools and an agile approach, I optimized the platform to integrate new products and channels with reduced complexity. To share insights, I authored and published three articles on LinkedIn—'Accelerating Business with Platforms,' 'Principles of a Digital Platform,' and 'Architecture of an Open Source Digital Platform'—which outlined key strategies for platform development and digital transformation."

### R – Result
"As a result, the time to develop new products and channels was reduced by 50%, and there was a 70% increase in financial product launches, significantly improving the bank's ability to meet market demands. The articles I published were well-received, garnering over 1,000 views on LinkedIn, which helped position both myself and the institution as thought leaders in platform digitization and business transformation."

# BV

### S – Situation
"I was tasked with designing and implementing a software system capable of handling more than two million daily requests. The system required robust scalability, security, and performance, as it was critical for the company’s operations. In addition, the project involved migrating system components to Google Cloud to improve overall efficiency and scalability."

### T – Task
"My role was to lead the design and implementation of the system, ensuring it adhered to scalability, security, and performance standards. I also oversaw the migration of various components to Google Cloud products and managed a team of six developers, ensuring the project stayed on track and met the technical requirements."

### A – Action
"To handle the system’s high request volume, I implemented a microservices architecture using Java and Spring for core services, along with Python for data processing tasks. I used RabbitMQ and Redis for message queuing and caching to optimize performance. The migration to Google Cloud involved moving key components to Firestore for database needs, PubSub for asynchronous messaging, and BigTable for scalable data storage. I also deployed the system on Kubernetes to manage containerized applications and ensure scalability. Throughout the project, I worked closely with my team to provide technical guidance and ensure best practices in security and performance were followed."

### R – Result
"As a result of the new system design and migration, we successfully handled over two million daily requests with improved scalability and performance. The system maintained high availability and met security requirements. The migration to Google Cloud significantly reduced infrastructure costs while improving response times. Under my leadership, the team successfully completed the project on time, and the new architecture enabled the company to efficiently scale operations as needed."

# Itau

### S – Situation
"The bank was seeking to modernize its infrastructure and reduce operational costs by moving its systems to a cloud-native architecture. The challenge was not only to migrate existing services but also to restructure the backend development stack to make the system scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient on the cloud, particularly using Amazon Web Services (AWS)."

### T – Task
"My role was to conceive and implement the cloud-native architecture, ensuring that all backend services were migrated to AWS. I was responsible for promoting a complete restructuring of the technology stack to ensure that every new microservice would operate on AWS, focusing on reducing database costs, increasing scalability, and improving system reliability."

### A – Action
"I designed and implemented a cloud-native architecture using technologies like Kotlin, Java, and Micronaut for microservice development, with Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration. I utilized Kafka for messaging and Hazelcast for distributed caching to ensure efficient data processing. AWS services such as EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) were used to manage containers, and gRPC was implemented for fast, reliable communication between services. Additionally, I worked on optimizing cloud data storage to reduce database costs, leveraging scalable and efficient storage solutions native to AWS. Jenkins was integrated into the pipeline to enable continuous integration and delivery."

### R – Result
"As a result of the new cloud-native architecture, the bank achieved a 40% reduction in database costs due to the optimized cloud data storage. The system became significantly more scalable and reliable, allowing the bank to efficiently manage larger workloads without impacting performance. The successful restructuring of the backend stack also ensured that every new microservice operated seamlessly on AWS, positioning the bank for future growth in the cloud."

# Santander 

### S – Situation
"I was tasked with enhancing the security and efficiency of the bank's digital channels, making them more independent of physical branches. Additionally, I was responsible for creating a backend framework to streamline development processes across various regions, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Spain, focusing on scalability, security, and developer best practices."

### T – Task
"My role was twofold: first, to implement a facial recognition solution to secure the bank's digital channels and second, to create a comprehensive backend framework that developers in multiple regions could use. The framework had to cover key areas such as code architecture, design patterns, testing, security measures, and performance optimization, all while ensuring seamless continuous integration and deployment."

### A – Action
"I implemented a facial recognition solution using Java, Kotlin, and Python integrated with the bank's digital channels. This allowed users to securely access services without needing to visit physical branches, enhancing both security and convenience.
